For our R&D Task: Voice Quality & Cost 
 
We need to ensure Kira maintains competitive voice quality at sustainable cost. Recent progress in TTS / speech models (e.g. Qwen3-TTS, LuxTTS) suggests meaningful improvements. The goal is to evaluate these and identify better alternatives than our current default (from Microsoft / AI foundry).
 
Quality goals
Fast / real-time
Stable and production-ready
Controllable and pleasant
Clear pronunciation
Multi-language support
Reasonable cost
Actionable
Prepare demo samples for commercial TTS models (azure-native models, elevenlabs, minimax)
Prepare demo samples for open-source TTS models (Qwen3-TTS, LuxTTS, personaplex)
For 10-20 sec demos, show the performance metrics, minimally including latency and cost, and ideally with suitable metrics aligned with quality goals.
Presentation should be non-technical friendly (i.e. Peiru, Kevin and other non-tech stakeholders can understand)
